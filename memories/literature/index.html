                    asleep under the night sky, <br>
                    dreaming about the most perfect girl, <br>
                    feeling the warmth of her hug, <br>
                    the taste of her kiss, <br>
                    the melody of her voice, <br>
                    then I woke up, <br>
                    and she was asleep right next to me.                
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>I wrote this, and yes you are the girl I spoke about, my pretty baby, my love. I love you soo much &lt;3</p>
