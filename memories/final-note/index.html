            <h1>So, Finally...</h1>
            <p>I don't want to bore you anymore, I'll end this with this final note.<br>It's been 7-8 months since we've
                met and 6 months since I asked you out (dates by 21-09-2022). During this time, I've had so much fun and
                you always kept me smiling. We had an amazing journey together, went through a lot of stuff together. We
                had our hard times, but we got through them and we are still together and I'm so happy we are. The best
                choice I ever made was to text you that day lol. I still remember that text - "you have great taste in
                music". Atleast something along those lines, but yeah. I'm so happy I met you and just fell in love with
                you.<br>You are the prettiest and the most perfect girl I ever will know. I love listening to you, I
                love playing video games with you, I love listening to music with you, I love watching movies with you,
                I just love everything about you. I hope we'll be together forever lol.<br>One day, when we can finally
                go and explore all the places we've wanted to, It'll be soo good. If in case, space travel gets
                commericalized, man I can't wait to go to the moon with you lol. It's cheesy but I wanna do it with
                you.<br>There's just so much I wanna do with you. Right now, I wanna say so much, but I don't wanna type
                it all lol. We have so much time ahead of us, and I'll tell all of it soon.<br>So, once again, Happy
                Birthday babyyyy! I love you sooo much!</p>
