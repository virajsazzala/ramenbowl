            <h1>The RamenBowl</h1>
            <p>So, while I was making this website, I got this idea. So, I thought, I could make you a website, like a personal website, where you can post whatever you want. A place for you on the internet, with no restrictions or boundaries. You can blog, rant, do anything you want. You might be worried about the maintanence part of the website, but don't worry about it, I'll make the base and I'll teach you some. After that, you can alter it the way you want.</p>
            <p>I wanted to do this because, I know you love the internet, and I know how much it means to you, so I thought this way, you can have your own space with full freedom and you can learn something new and cool while doing that.</p>
            <p>I've started making it, I'll let you know when It's done!</p>
