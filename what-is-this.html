            <p>So, you must be wondering what this website is about, and honestly, I don't have a specific answer. But, what I can tell you is, keep going ahead, and you might find things you'll like. I took everything I thought you would like and some other things I want you to take a look at and put it on this website. I spent a lot of time, trying to come up with some gift for you, but I had so many choices, and you know how confused I get, so in the end, I decided to do this. Mainly, I want to tell you soo much, and I thought this would be an interesting way to do it hehe.</p>
            <p>PS: I suck at making websites, so sorry for how shitty this looks :(</p>
