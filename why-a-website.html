            <p>Well, the reason I chose to make a website is, wait actually there are a lot of reasons lol. But, I mainly made this because I wanted to make sure you'll never lose this. If i gifted you something physical and something else like that, sooner or later, it might be lost, but this will be here for a really long time and everytime you feel lost, sad, anxious or anything close, this could be like a reminder that I'm always there for you and will always love you &lt;3 </p>
